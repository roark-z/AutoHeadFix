Mounting Hard Drive
--------------------

AutoHeadFix records many videos and an external hard drive is necessary.

* Make sure your hard drive is powered by an external hub, as the pi itself may not provide enough voltage for the hard drive. *

You will also need to format and mount your hard drive as outlined `here <https://medium.com/@aallan/adding-an-external-disk-to-a-raspberry-pi-and-sharing-it-over-the-network-5b321efce86a>`_ .
